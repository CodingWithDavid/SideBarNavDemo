## Why

I like the current navigation view that is shipped with the current Blazor template, but after working with it so long, I wanted to try some new navigations.  This is my first attempt

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```Command Line
   git clone https://github.com/CodingWithDavid/SideBarNavDemo
   cd SideBarNavDemo
   ```

1.	Open in Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Code
a.	With Visual Code you will need to install the C# extensions
2.	Press F5

## What's in the App

1. HTML and CSS for the visual navigation control
2. C# is used to "Pin" the nav to the open position.
3. Media queries are used to handle the responsiveness

## Worth Noting
Font awesome is used for the fonts.  I have removed the link to font awesome because it is specific to my account.  You can use your won link or replace the fonts with some other library.
